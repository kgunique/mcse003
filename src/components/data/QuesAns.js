        ques:"Write Chinese room test. Which limitations of Turing test are addressed Chinese room test ?",
        ans:"The Chinese room is designed to show that the Turing test is insufficient to detect the presence of consciousness, even if the room can behave or function as a conscious mind would.Indeed, it's not necessary for a program to speak in order for it to be intelligent. Thus, many humans and intelligent systems would likely fail the Turing Test. ... Moreover, the Turing Test is a poor test of intelligence â€” one that it encourages trickery, not intelligent behaviour"

        ques:"What is an Expert System ? Briefly explain the shells of Expert System",
        ans:"An expert system is a computer program that uses artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to simulate the judgment and behavior of a human or an organization that has expert knowledge and experience in a particular field.The main purpose of ES is to replicate knowledge and skills of human experts in a particular area, and then to use this knowledge to solve similar problems without human experts participation.The generic components of a shell : the knowledge acquisition, the knowledge Base, the reasoning, the explanation and the user interface"

        ques:"What are Fuzzy sets ? How do Fuzzy sets differ from Crisp sets ? What is the relevance of Fuzzy logic in Artificial Intelligence?",
        ans:"Crisp set defines the value is either 0 or 1.	Fuzzy set defines the value between 0 and 1 including both 0 and 1 while Crisp is also called a classical set.Fuzzy specifies the degree to which something is true. Crisp set shows full membership while fuzzy sets shows partial membership"
